# EV-battery-thermal-management

*PROJECT STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT*

In this project, I have used Arduino MKR Wifi1010 to manage the thermal conditions of an EV battery
and also display the information on the Arduino cloud.

Milestones completed:
1. Succesfully upload real time temperature of the battery to the cloud.
2. Turn on motors to cool the battery when temperature reaches a certain threshold.

Upcoming updates:
1. Update the user interface on the MKR carrier.
2. Add heating element.
